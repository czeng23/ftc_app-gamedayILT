## Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build Team 5197's competition
code for FTC Southern California InterLeague C1, F and O Meet 3, to be held January 27, 2018 at
Perris High School. It is based the FTC Software Development Kit (SDK) version 3.4. 

## Downloading Projects
### Downloading the FIRST SDK
To use that SDK v 3.4, download/clone that entire project to your local computer from 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/releases. 

Look for version 3.4. 
### Downloading our code
To use our code, download or clone from this URL:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://github.com/jrasor/ftc_app-gamedayILT

If you are new to the *FIRST* Tech Challenge software and control system, start with version 3.5.
You should visit the online wiki to learn how to install, configure, and use the software and 
control system:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/wiki

Note that the wiki is an "evergreen" document that is constantly being updated and edited.  It contains the most current information about the *FIRST* Tech Challenge software and control system.

## Downloading Big Projects
These repositories are large and can take a long time and use a lot of space to download. If you would 
like to save time and space, there are some options that you can choose to download only the most 
current version of either project folder:

* If you are a git user, *FIRST* recommends that you use the --depth command line argument to only 
clone the most current version of either repository:

<p>SDK v 3.5: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app.git</p>
<p>SDK v 3.4: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/releases. </p>
<p>5197: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/jrasor/ftc_app-gamedayILT</p>

* Or, if you prefer, you can use the "Download Zip" button available through the main repository 
page. Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.

* You can also download the project folder (as a .zip or .tar.gz archive file) from the Downloads subsection of the Releases page for this repository.

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").
