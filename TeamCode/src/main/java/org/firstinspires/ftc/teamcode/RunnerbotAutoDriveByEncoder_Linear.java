/**
 * This file illustrates the concept of driving a path based on encoder counts.
 *   It uses the common sample HardwarePushbot class to define the drive on the robot,
 *   minimally adapted to our Runnerbot as HardwareRunnerbot.
 *
 * This opmde extends LinearOpMode.
 *
 * It requires encoders on the two motor gangs. This code uses the RUN_TO_POSITION mode to enable
 *   the Motor controllers to set a movement goal, monitor the actual movement of the motors, and
 *   take action to reduce the difference.
 *
 * To calibrate, program a path, calculate where the robot should be at the end of it, run this
 *   opmode, and see where the robot actually ends up. Then adjust hardware or software to reduce
 *   the difference.
 *
 *  The code is written using a primitive method called: encoderDrive(speed, leftInches,
 *  rightInches, timeoutS). That comes with this opmode. If it works well, it can be backported
 *  to the HardwareRunnerbot class, or to other West Coast drive robot classes.
 *
 * v 0.1 1/6/18 JMR minimally adapted from sample "PushbotAutoDriveByEncoder_Linear".
 * v 0.11 1/10/18 JMR adapted documentation.
